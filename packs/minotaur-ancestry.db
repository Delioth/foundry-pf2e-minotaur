However, many overlook the minotaur tribes ranging from nomadic tribes to established communities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Minotaur adventurers are often younger minotaur - some who feel their natural cunning is wasted in the village life, and some who wish to make a good name for their tribe. These minotaur are often taken with a deep wanderlust, looking to travel to the ends of the land and beyond. Even so, adventurous minotaur usually feel an intrinsic duty to their folk - both to their tribe and to the comrades they find along the way.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>You might&hellip;</h2>\n<p>&bull; Have an innate drive to roam far and wide</p>\n<p>&bull; Be fascinated by mazes, labyrinths, and puzzles</p>\n<p>&bull; Be very set in your ways of thinking</p>\n<h2>Others probably&hellip;</h2>\n<p>&bull; Believe you won't listen to reason</p>\n<p>&bull; Expect you to act like a big, dumb animal</p>\n<p>&bull; Recognize your deep cunning and clever efficiency</p>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Large, bovine humanoids, minotaur stand at least 9 feet tall, some ranging as tall as 15 feet tall, the largest nearing a 1000-pound heft while smaller ones average closer to 550 pounds. Their heads are bovine, typically mimicing a bull, but some minotaur populations have the heads of yaks or buffalo as well. Their bodies are covered in a thin layer of neutral-colored fur, and their legs end in hooves. Minotaur often stand with a noticeable hunch, making them seem shorter than they truly are.</p>\n<p>Minotaurs reach adulthood around age 15, and are often kicked out of their homes around the same time, living to an old age of around 150 years.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Minotaur society at its core is driven by their wanderlust and their diligence. Most minotaur settlements are near the sea, where the people make incredible sailors and fearsome warriors. They rarely form close bonds with their families, preferring to keep company with the crews of their ships or skilled workers in their respective fields.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Delioth's Dossier: Minotaur"},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","hb_minotaur"],"rarity":"uncommon","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-01T14:45:34.430-05:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.9.2.11293"}}},"hp":10,"size":"lg","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["str"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common","jotun"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["dwarven","gnomish","goblin","orcish","terran"],"custom":""},"items":{"35thf":{"pack":"pf2e-minotaur.minotaur-ancestry","id":"T6EUd9HvirTza9LV","img":"icons/creatures/mammals/bull-horns-eyes-glowin-orange.webp","name":"Horns","level":0}},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"gKRAixZcnc2H4VRx":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.f8rVWoZTeddUz0IE"}},"_id":"AedprYUmPpI6DGdm"}
